NOTE: there must always be a space between the field and the value

In the config.txt you will see this:

"
bot-token: Your bot token goes here
bot-command-prefix: Your command prefix goes here
give-role-cmd-permission: List of all roles that can use this command goes here
"

Lets skip the token part for now.

What is a bot command prefix?
Basically a thing that goes before the command when a user is typing a command.
So for example when our command prefix is '!' we have to type in '!command' and if '?' was the command prefix
we would have to type "?command". So as the 'bot-command-prefix' field set it what do you want to type before the command.

#TODO explain the bot token part
#TODO explain the give role cmd permission part
