In the config.txt you will see this:

"
bot-token: Your bot token goes here
bot-command-prefix: Your command prefix goes here
"

Lets skip the token part for now.

What is a bot command prefix?
Basically a thing that goes before the command when a user is typing a command.
So for example when our command prefix is '!' we have to type in '!command' and if '?' was the command prefix
we would have to type "?command". So as the 'bot-command-prefix' field set it what do you want to type before the command.
